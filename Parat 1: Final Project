# Part 1: Final Project

# Outline

## High Level Sumamary

In this final project, I will bring the topic about Earth Hour which is a global movement that aims to reduce global energy consumption in this case electricity consumption, by turning light off worldwide for 1 hour while making it as a symbol to increase people awareness about important environmental issues such as climate change. 
As we know, Climate change is a significant and long-term shifts in global climate patterns. These changes primarily resulted from the emission of greenhouse gases such as Carbon dioxide (CO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen oxides (NOx),Particulate matter (PM), Heavy metals such as mercury into the atmosphere. 
In the United States, about 61% of total electricity generation in 2021 came from plants that burn fossil fuels (coal, oil, or natural gas), biomass, or municipal and industrial wastes. When these plants burn their fuel, they release a wide range of gases and toxins, which I already explained. This has significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. This increase enhances the greenhouse effect, trapping heat and causing the Earth's average temperature to rise. 
The consequences of climate change include rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, more frequent and severe weather events (such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods), melting glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels, shifts in ecosystems and habitats, and impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human health. 

In this project, I will utilize data visualization to illustrate :

•	Energy consumption trends over time and geographically
•	Electricity Generation trends over time and geographically, 
•	Environmental impact of electricity consumption/generation. Visualization of key statistics on carbon emissions, energy usage, and environmental degradation.
•	Infographic highlighting the environmental benefits or milestones of Earth Hour.

And also I will add how are the ways as information students can help to reduce the energy consumption in order to help save our earth from climate change, By engaging students through compelling visualizations and storytelling, the goal is to inspire them to take action and participate in Earth Hour initiatives.

## Project Structure

### Introduction

•	Energy consumption trends over time and geographically.

•	Electricity Generation trends over time and geographically.

•	Explanation of Earth Hour and its significance.

Earth Hour is a really positive and impactful event that happens once a year, usually at the end of March. It's organized by a group called the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). During Earth Hour, people all around the world turn off unnecessary lights and appliances for just one hour, from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. local time.
The point of Earth Hour is to raise awareness about important environmental issues, especially climate change. By switching off lights and saving electricity for that one hour, we show that even small actions can make a big difference in helping the planet
But Earth Hour isn't just about turning off lights. It's also about encouraging everyone to think about how they use energy every day and how they can do it in a more eco-friendly way. It's like a reminder to be more mindful of the environment and to try to use resources wisely.
What's really awesome about Earth Hour is that it brings people together from all over the world. Millions of people take part, showing that we all care about the planet and want to work together to protect it. Whether you're in a big city or a small town, participating in Earth Hour can make you feel like you're part of a global team that's making a positive impact.
Earth Hour is not just about turning off lights—it's about raising awareness, promoting sustainable habits, and joining forces to make the world a better place for everyone.

### The Problem

•	Environmental impact of energy consumption. Visualization of key statistics on carbon emissions, energy usage, and environmental degradation.

Climate Change: When we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for energy, they release gases like carbon dioxide into the air. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing global warming and changes in our climate. This can lead to more extreme weather, higher sea levels, and problems for plants and animals.

### Earth Hour Impact and Milestone so far

Infographic highlighting the environmental benefits or milestones of Earth Hour.

### Call to Action

•	Emphasize the importance of individual actions in combatting climate change.
•	Provide practical tips and suggestions for sustainable living beyond Earth Hour.

### Conclusion

•	Recap of key insights from the campaign.
•	Reinforcement of the significance of environmental stewardship.

# Data

A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.
