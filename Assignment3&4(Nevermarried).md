# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)

# Step 1 : choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday

For step one, I tried to scan around 10-25 types of data visualization that i want to criticize and redesign afterwards, it take significant amount of time actually to decide which one to go with. There are several graphics that really interests me to choose such as Benefits of Remote Work, How much does cocaine cost around the world? Who do we spend time with across our lifetimes? What Schools Create the Most Student Loans in the U.S.? and many more. Those are interesting charts and contents, but as i hover around all of em i ended up choosing nce that caught my attention more, **Percentage of Never Married Adults Is on the Rise** due to the graphic visual that looks interesting to be criticize and also i'm curious about the topic of marriage since it sort of become more of a trend right now for youngsters-adults (at least in my country Indonesia), but this is contrast with what the article and graph wants to tell to the audience, that makes it interesting for me. Also because i want to explore and learn more about tableau, i chose the video that has a tutorial video from watch me viz

# Step 2 : critique the data visualization

For this part I already completed a critique using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf. 

I've already submitted it on the Google Spreadsheet using the criteria given, and I also used it to analyze a data visualization of my choosing. 

The process of this step also took significant amount of time, i tried to really get the grasp of what the effectivenes profile criteria really want us to do, and how to really try to measure visuals using that tool which have numbers to decided on as well. I tried to compare and look back a lot with the previous critique tool using the one in the good charts book method which used for fitara critique back then.

Since i already submitted to the long explanation on the google form, in here i will try to elaborate it again since it actually uses my own words as well, the summary insights gleaned from the critique method :

**Usefulness**  Is it useful for the intended audience?  Does it communicate valuable information?

From my findings, i can say that the data visualization at first glance gave a pretty useful values and information about the percentage of never married adults by gender and age, we can see the percentage between age range groups and also by census year (2006, 2016). The percentage can represent the number of never married adults per total amount of adults in the census, so it is a good way to choose percentage as the y-axis to easily show the information of big or small the portion of never married adults are. But my question as an audience I looked at the headline that says “Never married on the Rise” but thinking of why the census years only use 2 years which cannot really validify the rise of never married adults, actually we need more census years to clearly show if the trend is really rising or not according to gender and age. But since the original article and data source that I checked thoroughly about never married adults are limited to those 2 years census for the never married report, it is pretty fair to say that the information given is useful for the audience and can tell the comparison of both genders and age groups by the percentage on each of those 2 years.


**Completeness**  Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?

For the completeness, in my opinion this chart is trying be simple, understandable, and use relevant data from the data source, but in the sense of completeness, it really needs more data to justify the headline of “never married on the rise”.  The thing I notice that the data can directly make us understand what it is trying to tell but it isn’t the best practice and cannot be justified fully. Since if we’re going to talk about the rise of never married adults we need more specific context on the numbers of comparison from each group and gender in that year, also historical value such as more census timeframe reports from the past till this year, with that amount of additional information, it can starts to really portray the valid trend, also it is much better as well if we can show numbers of never married adult to also can immediately correlate it with the percentage, so the reader can have a view of how much it actually is, if there are enough information of these numbers in the data source, but actually percentage itself can already represent the meaning. Also I think the headline is not complete, it should be state more like this “Never Married Adults on the rise in the U.S in 2 specific years” or “The rise of Never Married Adults in the U.S in 2006 and 2016” since the survey also conducted in United States and only use 2 timeframes (2006 and 2016) it is supposed to be there to avoid misleading. Also I wanted to criticize the brief explanation below the headline but I think it is actually pretty simple and straight forward and the readers can get the meaning as well, they can pretty easily correlate the explanation with the graph x-axis, but it is better to make it like “Sex and Age Groups”.

**Perceptibility**  Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate?  Does it use illogical comparisons?

For the perception, the amount of eye traveling and brain perception to understand the information is fairly clear and easy with not much effort, so it portrays that reader can understand without having to suffer much, but the visualization type especially the graph is not actually appropriate or on point in a sense that it is better to portray the rise of never married adult from left to right (bar chart position) instead of right to left, in this context it is much more indicating downward trend if the reader do not read or catch the title. A great graph should make the reader navigate more easily without even need to read all the information in the chart (title, brief explanation, etc). Also it will be better if the 2006 woman chart within certain age groups can be place side by side with the 2016 woman chart to make the audience more easier to look and compare by each gender, because it is more logical to do so. In the data visualization, the men bar chart kind of blocking in the middle if the reader wants to instantly compare woman. This should be done to both men and woman gender chart. The use of percent as the y-axis title is better to change it to “Percentage of Never Married Adults by sex and age groups” while on each top of the bar chart should add percentage numbers to make it more easily to understand and read.

**Truthfulness** Is the visualization accurate, reliable and valid?  Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisons that aren't correct?

For the truthfulness, the data visualization comes from a valid data source, eventhough the census only have 2 years (2006, 2016) instead more historical year report, so it still can be compare the accuracy of the data from the source and what portrayed in the bar chart, the visualization is accurate because it reflects the data source that it use for the correct percentage of never married adults, the correct age groups range, and the correct census years. For the completeness and truthful manner, I can say that the data visualization trying to tell us about the rising of never married adults by gender and age but it kind of intentionally use only 2 census years to make the comparison and trend between the bar graph to keep looks increasing for any age groups. I think this can be said as incomplete and hidden information that can be risky to lead to a misleading information or assumptions for the readers, this might intentionally done to push the reader to think that the graph trend is valid while solely relying on the 2 years timeframe graph without the complete information. As per the size of bar chart, it is logical and make sense in according to the percentage, it can be seen that twice bar chart means twice the percentage or near. The title also said the never married adults percentage by sex and age and the graph is correctly show the things accordingly, so it is accurate and reliable as well. The graph also include or cite the source of data, so it wants the reader to trust the data in the graph since they attach the source.

**Intuitiveness** Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information?  If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on how to interpret it?

As for intuitiveness, the graph doesn’t have complex form, design, and variables. it uses a familiar form which is a simple bar chart with different colors to separate gender, to make us easily understand the information it wants to show. Also when using intuition for understanding the meaning of the graph, I think that the headline and brief explanation below it are not that sufficient in the context of instructions  to understand the whole meaning of the graph, it should state more like in the perception section that I mentioned before “Never Married Adults on the rise in the U.S in 2 specific years” or “The rise of Never Married Adults in the U.S in 2006 and 2016” to give it more intuitive and clear instructions since the survey also conducted in United States and only use 2 timeframes (2006 and 2016) it is supposed to be there to avoid misleading.  If we don’t use this, its quite taking some time to think and learn, what are the years in the x-axis actually means ? If the word United States Census in the bottom is not there people might be confused in the first place, so it mean readers should see all the content before can actually grasp the whole meaning of the graph. Also there is not much additional useful instructions besides the title and the brief explanation which are incomplete too, it is better if there is a pointer to the years and give additional information about the census timeframes such as “percentage of never married adults by sex and gender in the united states, taken from 2 years census, this can make the reader can intuitively understand what is happening in the graph, It is also better if it can add the percentage numbers on top of each bar chart to make it more easy to understand.

**Aesthetics**  Is it interesting / enjoyable to look at?  Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like?  Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at?

As for the aesthetics, the data visualization is designed to be fairly simple and enjoyable but not quite that interesting, it can be done much better by doing different changes. Since the data used to generate the chart are not that complex, the design tends to be made simpler. The aestethic is not that beautiful in the sense of can invite more attraction to people who less care about the information given in the context, but if the reader are interested in reading about the context of never married adults on the rise, it seems the headline and content information does more job than the graph, so it can be said it is in between ugly and beautiful, but still a bit pleasing to the eye, not created much confusion and hurting the reader’s eye. Eventhough, the use of colors in the bar chart and legends tend to be more interesting to see since they have 2 different colors which can separate the genders quite clear, but it would be pretty nice if it use more softer colors to ease the eye of the reader, sometimes bold contrast colors such as bold blue and red can be unpleasant for some people eyes, so I recommend using like light blue and light red, or light green and light purple, and many more pleasing combinations. The thing that I don’t understand is what is the use of the cartoon icon of a person holding pencil next to the headline, it doesn’t necessary needed and if I can change it to only the status board it suppose to be sufficient enough to still make sense of the context. Also, another distracting part is the positioning of men and woman graph being next to each other, it can be more appealing if it can be side by side with its own gender to make comparison bar chart more aesthetics as well. It is also more aestethic if it can show the percentage above the bar charts, that makes it more appealing as well. Also it is good to add more font to the segmentation of age groups,  to make it more easy to read for older people, this also can be done to the font size and color of the source in the bottom of the graph, it suppose to use more clear white color and bigger the font size to make it more visible to the eye. The color of the percents in the y-axis and the lines are also recommended to be change because it is not pretty visible to the eye it kind of like wanting to disappear, so should just change aqua color to black and I think it can be more visible and pleasing.  
 
**Engagement** Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic?  Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others?

It is a pretty straightforward information without much instructions, pointers, and correct headline to help make the graphic tells more stories. As for me as a reader, personally I found this graph pretty simple to engage with and not creating much confusion about the terms, variables, the high vocabulary words, but it is true that this is not that aestethically appealing of the graph, for that aspect it doesn’t create pretty much engagement for people to be curious because the information given is pretty simple, so that the audience that trying to dig more deeper about the context doesn’t really intrigued by the visualization graph, even though the information is pretty useful and interesting for some people. But having a not so appealing visual, the good thing I saw is the headline, eventhough I think it is not complete and missing many words that can emphasize more of the graph context, I must admit that I was a bit hooked by the headline to be honest, because it intrigues my sense of curiosity of how much people that never been married. It is an interesting topics nowadays since the marriage trend is increasing according to what I saw on social media, but there is graph portrays the opposite. As for the distraction from the data, I think since it uses a simple 2-D bar chart, it kind of not having much distraction as for using 3-D bar chart or other 3-D charts, but what I found distracting is the unclear pointer, index or instructions  for the y-axis (2006, 2016) (25-29 years) and so on, because I need to look up and down for the headline or brief explanation to understood the context but it still many better ways to write the brief explanation and adding more instructions to make it more easily understandable and more engaging. Also the font and colors that are used need to be repick with bigger fonts and more softer color but still really visible for the reader’s eye.

**Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?**

The primary audience for this data visualization are adults from 25 years old until 55 years old and older who wants to know the trend of never married adults or adults who might consider to have marriage in their life but still not haven’t done so. The visualization can be change to become more user friendly to compare for each age groups and gender, we can actually use the bar chart since it is actually pretty clear but with added instructions, pointers, percentage on top of the bars, also can add more improvement on the fonts size and colors. 

**Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)**

This method solidifies many things related to how to effectively tell stories with the data viz that are according to the 7 elements, each criteria I think has some added values and crucial part of creating more objective critique towards a visualization or graph, it is a really great way to measure ones visualization. The approach is totally different with the one we do before the first critique assignment where the techniques mostly hover on frequent general observation approaches, such as what do you see first in the graph generally and immediately, instantly think of first ideas and iterate accordingly, what I like, what I dislike, what I wish I saw, and then giving recommendations on what to improve or change, the different approach have more focus on being more subjective. The approach we use here make it to asses it more objective since the score range are completely based on several criteria and using 7 elements that makes the assessment more focused to make it easier for reader to digest and useful as a whole.

# Step 3 : sketch out a solution

Now that i haved developed some ideas around how to improve the data visualization I selected with the critique i did before and also other insights that comes in mind alongwards, in step three I already created around 6 different sketches, but ended up coming with only 4 sketches using tableau that i think can answer my doubts on how to make the redesigning much better than the original image. 

**1st sketch**

# Step 4 : Test the solution

For this step, i already tried to share my sketches with three different people and ask for their feedback. I also try to not walk them through my visualization.  Rather, i let them to see my sketches without any guidance, i want to see if they can understand the basics of my designs without me having to explain too much to them. I just said i create this using tableau and please answer several of these questions for my assignment, and they directly response without asking clarification for my image (which i think i have several sketches that easy to understand what i wanted to portray).

this is my simple script that i use as a way to take notes as i move forwad.   


- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

- which one is clear and interest you the most ? why?


student, mid 20's
student, mid 30's
adult, late 50's


These are their feedback


And then i try to question myself,

What patterns in the feedback emerge?  
What did you learn from the feedback? 


And i used the feedback from this step to guide my final redesign. Also i tried to go back to MakeoverMonday and view any redesigns. But my video only have a tableau tutorial without a critique competitions like some others graphic choices. Eventhough, i still tried to watch several of other graphic contents that the presenter will critique about its data visualizations that were created as part of the redesign challenge, but i pretty much use the insights for ideas of creating sketches, since the sketch i create are more than 1.


# Step 5 : Build your solution

For this final step, i tried to implement the feedback that i received on my proposed solution, also already modified and designed the solution using tableau tools.
