# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)

## Brilian Pracoyo Adi (badi@andrew.cmu.edu)

# Step 1 : choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday

For step one, I tried to scan around 10-25 types of data visualization that i want to criticize and redesign afterwards, it take significant amount of time actually to decide which one to go with. There are several graphics that really interests me to choose such as Benefits of Remote Work, How much does cocaine cost around the world? Who do we spend time with across our lifetimes? What Schools Create the Most Student Loans in the U.S.? and many more. Those are interesting charts and contents, but as i hover around all of em i ended up choosing nce that caught my attention more, **Percentage of Never Married Adults Is on the Rise** due to the graphic visual that looks interesting to be criticize and also i'm curious about the topic of marriage since it sort of become more of a trend right now for youngsters-adults (at least in my country Indonesia), but this is contrast with what the article and graph wants to tell to the audience, that makes it interesting for me. There are also several criticize criterias like perception, intuitiveness, completeness, aestethics that i have in mind to critic on this one (that i will explain further in step 2), and last but not least because i want to explore and learn more about tableau, so i chose the graph that has a tutorial video from watch me viz tableau and using data sets from the original make over monday.

# Step 2 : critique the data visualization

For this part I already completed a critique using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf. 

I've already submitted it on the Google Spreadsheet ansering based on the criteria given, and I also used it to analyze a data visualization of my choosen graph. 

The process of this step also took significant amount of time, i tried to really get the grasp of what the effectivenes profile criteria really want us to do, and how to really try to measure visuals using that tool which have numbers to decided on as well. I tried to compare and look back a numerous of times with the previous critique tool using the one in the good charts book method which used for fitara critique back then to understand the difference.

Since i already submitted to the long explanation on the google form, in here i will try to elaborate it again because it actually uses my own words as well, the insights gleaned from the Stephen Few's critique method :

**Usefulness**  Is it useful for the intended audience?  Does it communicate valuable information? **i score it 8**

From my findings, i can say that the data visualization at first glance gave a pretty useful values and information about the percentage of never married adults by gender and age, we can see the percentage between age range groups and also by census year (2006, 2016). The percentage can represent the number of never married adults per total amount of adults in the census, so it is a good way to choose percentage as the y-axis to easily show the information of big or small the portion of never married adults are. But my question as an audience I looked at the headline that says “Never married on the Rise” but thinking of why the census years only use 2 years which cannot really validify the rise trends of never married adults, actually we need more census years to clearly show if the trend is really rising or not according to gender and age. But since the original article and data source that I checked thoroughly about never married adults are limited to those 2 years census for the never married report, it is pretty fair to say that the information given is useful for the audience and can tell the comparison of both genders and age groups by the percentage on each of those 2 years.


**Completeness**  Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable? **i score it 7**

For the completeness, in my opinion this chart is trying be simple, understandable, and use relevant data from the data source, but in the sense of completeness, it really needs more data to justify the headline of “never married on the rise”.  The thing I noticed that the data can directly make us understand what it is trying to tell but it isn’t the best practice and cannot be justified fully. Since if we’re going to show the trend of the rise of never married adults, we need more specific context on the numbers of comparison from each group and gender in that year, also historical value such as more census timeframe reports from the past till this year, with that amount of additional information, it can start to really portray the valid trend, also it is much better as well if we can show numbers of never married adult percentage on top of each bars. to also can immediately correlate it with the percentage, so the reader can have a more complete view. Also I think the headline is not complete, it should be state more like this “Never Married Adults on the rise in the U.S in 2 specific years” or “The rise of Never Married Adults in the U.S in 2006 and 2016” since the survey also conducted in United States and only use 2 timeframes (2006 and 2016) it is supposed to be there to avoid misleading. Also I wanted to criticize the brief explanation below the headline but I think it is actually pretty simple and straight forward and the readers can get the meaning as well, they can pretty easily correlate the explanation with the graph x-axis, but it is better to make it like “Sex and Age Groups”.

**Perceptibility**  Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate?  Does it use illogical comparisons? **I score it 7**

For the perception, the amount of eye traveling and brain perception to understand the information is fairly clear and easy with not much effort, so it portrays that reader can understand without having to suffer much, but the visualization type especially the graph is not actually appropriate or on point in a sense that it is better to portray the rise of never married adult from left to right (bar chart position) instead of right to left, in this context it is much more indicating downward trend if the reader do not read or catch the title. A great graph should make the reader navigate more easily without even need to read all the information in the chart (title, brief explanation, etc). Also it will be better if the 2006 woman chart within certain age groups can be place side by side with the 2016 woman chart to make the audience more easier to look and compare by each gender, because it is more logical to do so. In the data visualization, the men bar chart kind of blocking in the middle if the reader wants to instantly compare woman. This should be done to both men and woman gender chart. The use of percent as the y-axis title is better to change it to “Percentage of Never Married Adults by sex and age groups” while on each top of the bar chart should add percentage numbers to make it more easily to understand and read.

**Truthfulness** Is the visualization accurate, reliable and valid?  Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisons that aren't correct? **I score it 7**

For the truthfulness, the data visualization comes from a valid data source, eventhough the census only have 2 years (2006, 2016) instead more historical year report, so it still can compare the accuracy of the data from the source and what portrayed in the bar chart, the visualization is accurate because it reflects the data source that it use for the correct percentage of never married adults, the correct age groups range, and the correct census years. For the completeness and truthful manner, I can say that the data visualization trying to tell us about the rising of never married adults by gender and age but it kind of intentionally use only 2 census years to make the comparison and trend between the bar graph to keep looks increasing for any age groups. I think this can be said as incomplete and also have a hidden information that can be risky to lead to a misleading information or assumptions for the readers, this might intentionally done to push the reader to think that the graph trend is valid while solely relying on the 2 years timeframe graph without the complete information. As per the size of bar chart, it is logical and make sense in according to the percentage, it can be seen that twice bar chart means twice the percentage or close. The title also said the never married adults percentage by sex and age and the graph is correctly show the things accordingly, so it is accurate and reliable as well. The graph also include or cite the source of data, so it wants the reader to trust the data in the graph since they attach the source.

**Intuitiveness** Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information?  If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on how to interpret it? **I score it 8**

As for intuitiveness, the graph doesn’t have complex form, design, and variables. it uses a familiar form which is a simple bar chart with different colors to separate gender, to make us easily understand the information it wants to show. Also when using intuition for understanding the meaning of the graph, I think that the headline and brief explanation below it are not that sufficient in the context of instructions  to understand the whole meaning of the graph, it should state more like in the perception section that I mentioned before “Never Married Adults on the rise in the U.S in 2 specific years” or “The rise of Never Married Adults in the U.S in 2006 and 2016” to give it more intuitive and clear instructions since the survey also conducted in United States and only use 2 timeframes (2006 and 2016) it is supposed to be there to avoid misleading.  If we don’t use this, its quite taking some time to think and learn, what are the years in the x-axis actually means ? If the word United States Census in the bottom is not there people might be confused in the first place, so it mean readers should see all the content before can actually grasp the whole meaning of the graph. Also there is not much additional useful instructions besides the title and the brief explanation which are incomplete too, it is better if there is an additional information about the census timeframes such as “percentage of never married adults by sex and gender in the united states, taken from 2 years census, this can make the reader can intuitively understand what is happening in the graph, It is also better if it can add the percentage numbers on top of each bar chart to make it more easy to understand.

**Aesthetics**  Is it interesting / enjoyable to look at?  Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like?  Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at? **I score it 7**

As for the aesthetics, the data visualization is designed to be fairly simple and enjoyable but not quite that visually interesting, it can be done much better by doing different changes on the colors and bar designs. Since the data used to generate the chart are not that complex, the design tends to be made simpler. The aestethic is not that beautiful in the sense of can invite more attraction to people who less care about the information given in the context, but if the reader are interested in reading about the context of never married adults on the rise, it seems the headline and content information does more job than the graph, so it can be said it is in between ugly and beautiful, but still a bit pleasing to the eye, not created much confusion and hurting the reader’s eye. Eventhough, the use of colors in the bar chart and legends tend to be more interesting to see since they have 2 different colors which can separate the genders quite clear, but it would be pretty nice if it use more softer colors to ease the eye of the reader, sometimes bold contrast colors such as bold blue and red can be unpleasant for some people eyes, so I recommend using like light green and light orange, or light pink and light blue, and many more pleasing combinations. The thing that I don’t understand is what is the use of the cartoon icon of a person holding pencil next to the headline, it doesn’t necessary needed and if I can change it to only the status board it suppose to be sufficient enough to still make sense of the context. Also, another distracting part is the positioning of men and woman graph being next to each other, it can be more appealing if it can be side by side with its own gender to make comparison bar chart more aesthetics as well. It is also more aestethic if it can show the percentage above the bar charts, that makes it more appealing as well. Also it is good to add more font to the segmentation of age groups,  to make it more easy to read for older people, this also can be done to the font size and color of the source in the bottom of the graph, it suppose to use more clear white color and bigger the font size to make it more visible to the eye. The color of the percents in the y-axis and the lines are also recommended to be change because it is not pretty visible to the eye it kind of like wanting to disappear, so should just change aqua color to black and I think it can be more visible and pleasing.  
 
**Engagement** Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic?  Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others? **I score it 7**

It is a pretty straightforward information without much instructions, pointers, and correct headline to help make the graphic tells more stories. As for me as a reader, personally I found this graph pretty simple to engage with and not creating much confusion about the terms, variables, the high vocabulary words, but it is true that this is not that aestethically appealing of the graph, for that aspect it doesn’t create pretty much engagement for people to be curious because the information given is pretty simple, so that the audience that trying to dig more deeper about the context doesn’t really intrigued by the visualization graph, even though the information is pretty useful and interesting for some people. But having a not so appealing visual, the good thing I saw is the headline, eventhough I think it is not complete and missing many words that can emphasize more of the graph context, I must admit that I was a bit hooked by the headline to be honest, because it intrigues my sense of curiosity of how much people that never been married. It is an interesting topics nowadays since the marriage trend is increasing according to what I saw on social media, but there is graph portrays the opposite. As for the distraction from the data, I think since it uses a simple 2-D bar chart, it kind of not having much distraction as for using 3-D bar chart or other 3-D charts, but what I found distracting is the unclear headline, index or instructions for the y-axis (2006, 2016) (25-29 years) and so on, because I need to look up and down for the headline or brief explanation to understood the context but it still many better ways to write the brief explanation and adding more instructions to make it more easily understandable and more engaging. Also the font and colors that are used need to be repick with bigger fonts and more softer color but still really visible for the reader’s eye.

**Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?**

The primary audience for this data visualization are people in general, especially adults from 25 years old until 55 years old and older who wants to know the trend of never married adults or adults who might consider to have marriage in their life but still not haven’t done so. The visualization can be change to become more user friendly to compare for each age groups and gender, we can actually use the bar chart since it is actually pretty clear but with added instructions, percentage on top of the bars, also can add more improvement on the headlines, graph view orientation, additional informations, fonts size and colors. These are already elaborated on each of the criteria answers above (emphasize more on colors, bar orientation, headlines, brief instructions or explanations).

**Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)**

This method solidifies many things related to how to effectively tell stories with the data viz that are according to the 7 elements, each criteria I think has some added values and crucial part of creating more objective critique towards a visualization or graph, it is a really great way to measure ones visualization. The approach is totally different with the one we do before with the method from good charts book, the first critique assignment where the techniques mostly hover on frequent general observation approaches, such as what do you see first in the graph generally and immediately, instantly think of first ideas and iterate accordingly, what I like, what I dislike, what I wish I saw, and then giving recommendations on what to improve or change, there are more criteria that have more focus on being more subjective. The approach we use now make it more easy to asses it more objective since the score range are completely based on several criteria and using 7 elements that makes the assessment more focused to make it easier for reader to digest and useful as a whole. For the recommendations i already mentioned on above citerias answers, regarding colors, type of visualization, layout, etc.

# Step 3 : sketch out a solution

Now that i haved developed some ideas around how to improve the data visualization I selected with the critique i did before and also other insights that comes in mind alongwards, in step three I already created around 6 different sketches, but ended up deciding with only 4 sketches using tableau that i think can answer my doubts and worth to ask feedback to other people as well on how to make the redesigning much better than the original image. 

## 1st Sketch

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1707280523990' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ne&#47;Nevermarriedsketch5&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Nevermarriedsketch5&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ne&#47;Nevermarriedsketch5&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
 var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1707280523990');                    
 var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                   
 vizElement.style.width='1400px';vizElement.style.height='927px';                    
 var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
 scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
 vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

In this sketching, i try to redesign the visualization to portray it differently from the original image also try to add another data to tell :

**Change of Graph Colors :** As in the critique before that i mention about changing colors, i actually implement my own critique to choose different colors that are more softer but still represents the different gender (women and men). for women i chose green for 2016 census year and light green for 2006 census year, for men i chose orange for 2016 census year and light orange for 2006 census year. As from previous original graph, the colors are only red for woman on both year, and purple for man on both year. In my sketches design, in my opinion it drastically improve the segmentation purpose more clearly than the original ones.

**Change of Headlines :** Also i changed headlines because i think the original ones doesnt clearly articulate or show a valid picture of what the graph tells, i changed it to "WOMEN AND MEN ACROSS ALL AGE GROUPS, THE PERCENTAGE OF NEVER MARRIED HAS INCREASED FROM 2006 TO 2016 in the U.S" to improve more clarity that the rise is happening in US since the census is from US census bureau, and also the year clearly articulated in the headline as well. Also i tried to to use colors for the headlines to easily make the intuitiveness and perception of the reader increased because it is easy to navigate and to understand. 

**Change of Brief Explanation :** I change the explanation brief below the heading to "increment from 2006 to 2016 showed in percentage" because i also wanted to tell the audience how much percentage increased from 2006 to 2016.

Change of Graph View Orientation : I also changed the view orientation of the bar chart, to make it horizontal instead of vertical, this is for experimenting if it will increase the clarity of the visualization or not, but i think it actually does. i also change the variables to make it grouping woman across all age, and man across all age in different sections instead same sections

**Additional changes :** For the additional changes that i made, i tried to group the graph based on gender and age horizontally, and make the y-axis represents the percentage of never married adults instead, i also add source and citaations in below.


## 2nd Sketch

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1707280282628' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard2 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ne&#47;Nevermarriedsketch6&#47;Dashboard2&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Nevermarriedsketch6&#47;Dashboard2' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ne&#47;Nevermarriedsketch6&#47;Dashboard2&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
 var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1707280282628');                    
 var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
 if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1300px';vizElement.style.height='927px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1300px';vizElement.style.height='927px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     
 var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
 scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
 vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);               
</script>

For this sketch i intentionally tried to make it the same as sketch 1 for the Change of Graph Colors and Change of Headlines since i found it a great narrative and visual for experimenting for the gathering feedback from others.

**Change of Brief Explanation :** I change the explanation brief below the headlng to "The percentage below representing never married adults percentage based on age and gender grouping" because i also wanted to show the audience percentage per each of the bar charts, i think it creates more clarity towards each of the data and what it tries to tell the audience.

**Change of Graph View Orientation :** I also keep the view orientation of the barchart as the same vertical as the original, but i tried to make it visually rising, since it can be done by reversing the age groups, because in my opinion the original graph actually show downtrends not a rising trend as far as the eye can see imemdiately, and also i tried to make a comparison between women 2016 with women 2006 bar chart, and men 2016 and men 2006 bar chart instead of having men and women side by side. I think the purpose of this is because if we want to compare the same gender, the other gender bar chart kinda blocks our way, so i think this is necessary to change.

**Additional changes :** For the additional changes that i made, i tried to group the graph based on gender and age. and make the y-axis represents the percentage of never married adults instead, i also add source and citaations in below. I also add legends for colors to make it more easy to understand and navigate.


## 3rd Sketch


<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1707280412461' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard3 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ne&#47;Nevermarriedsketch7&#47;Dashboard3&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Nevermarriedsketch7&#47;Dashboard3' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ne&#47;Nevermarriedsketch7&#47;Dashboard3&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>

 var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
 if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1400px';vizElement.style.height='927px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1400px';vizElement.style.height='927px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}

 vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

In this sketching, i try to redesign the visualization to portray it differently from the original image also try to add another data to tell :

**Change of Colors :** For this sketch I try to use different colors for experimenting which sketches will be more appealing to the audience, also which one work best to portray the genders. other reasons are the same as sketches before.

**Change of Headlines :** I try to experiment changing the headline as well, this one i change it to "THE RISE OF NEVER MARRIED ADULTS BOTH WOMEN AND MEN IN THE U.S IN FROM 2006 TO 2016" to actually says the word rise but with more added information of the country and the time frame, different from the original image which doesnt include this.

**Change of Brief Explanation :** this is the same as 2nd sketch, "The percentage below representing never married adults percentage based on age and gender grouping".

**Change of Graph View Orientation :** In this graph i tried to experiment something different using line chart to with the similiar grouping as the 1st sketch horizontally and splitting between genders. I do this to try to see if using another form of charts rather than bar chart can help portray the information much better. I also tried to make it to look downtrend as to experiment how the audience see it pretty normal, or not inline with the headline which is rising, since the original image is also looking downtrend.

**Additional changes :** I change the variables location between rows and columns, trying to see different perspectives and angles that we can tell to the audience. In this case i make the years and age on x-axis and the percentage on the y-axis, different from the previous 2 sketches, since i want to experiment which one works better for the perception of the audience which i will ask feedback on. I also add legends for the genders with the different groups and age range.

In this sketching, i try to redesign the visualization to portray it differently from the original image also try to add another data to tell :

For this sketch i intentionally tried to make it the same as sketch 3 for the Change of Graph Colors and Change of Headlines since i found it a great narrative and visual for experimenting for the gathering feedback from others. So i planned to split sketch 1-2 having the same colors and headline, and sketch 3-4 having the same colors and headline. Because i think those colors are enough to portray my own critique, but it just needs adjustment in the graph and how you want to portray the data.

**Change of Brief Explanation :** this is the same as 3rd sketch, "The percentage below representing never married adults percentage based on age and gender grouping".

**Change of Graph View Orientation :** In this graph i tried to use bar chart again but trying to make it downtrend again like the orginial, just to see others feedback on which one is more easy to navigate and understandable according to the headline if you see an uptrend or downtrend. I also use the same variables position and segmentation as the 2nd sketch.

**Additional changes :** Since i want to experiment which one works better for the perception of the audience which i will ask feedback on. I also add legends for the genders with the different groups and age range. This change actually trying to make 2nd sketch reversed and experimenting the details to make the different persepective and can be intrigue people to give more variety of feedback and opinion.


# Step 4 : Test the solution

For this step, i already tried to share my sketches with four different people and ask for their feedback. I also try to not walk them through my visualization.  Rather, i let them to see my sketches without any guidance, i want to see if they can understand the basics of my designs without me having to explain too much to them. I just said i create this using tableau and please answer several of these questions for my assignment, and they directly response without asking clarification for my image (which i think i have several sketches that easy to understand what i wanted to portray).

this is my simple script that i use as a way to take notes as i move forwad.   


- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

- which one is clear and interest you the most ? why?

- what about the color, which sketches do you find appealing?

- what about the headline, which sketches do you find appealing?

**student, mid 20's**

1. This is a chart that tells us about people who never get married.
2. ⁠The report is telling us about the rise of the percentage of the people who never get married. It compares the number between men and women
3. ⁠the third chart is confusing because the year 2016 is put first in front of 2006
4. ⁠no idea, probably an event planner who specializes in wedding events
5. ⁠better to be consistent with the year - put 2006 first
6. The 2nd sketch is the one i think its clear since the graphic is rising
7. The third and fourth graph as the color are contrast pink and blue
8. The third and fourth graph headlines, since it contains rise

**student, mid 30's**

1. Statistic visualization of never married men and women with certain demographics
2. The number of never married men or women has increased in 2016 across all age categories
3. not really, in this technological era people tend to be more self satiated with all the things they can get online
4. Intended audience is the government, or for people in general
5. no
6. the first graph (horizontal bar)
7. the first sketch, due to its more uniform hue depicting men and women
8. The rise of never married adults both men and women


**student, late 20's**
1. These charts illustrate the growing trend of individuals in the United States, encompassing both women and men and age groups, who are opting for a lifestyle of remaining unmarried.
2. The charts suggest a rising trend of waning interest in marriage among individuals.
3. Confusing: Charts No. 3 and 4 are somewhat interesting as they display 2016 data before 2006. It's intriguing how the chronological order is reversed. Intuitively, I would prefer a historical sequence, expecting 2006 to precede 2016, as people generally read from left to right, although not universally.
4. It appears to be designed for the general public (adults), and I anticipate seeing this information in a newspaper.
5. Nitpicky: I don’t know the sequence of how all the 4 charts would be presented but if all 4 of the charts are presented simultaneously (all at once), consistency is crucial. However, I see in Chart No. 1 and 4, data begins with individuals aged 55+ and progressively moves to younger generations, while in No. 2 and 3, the sequence starts with 25-29 and progresses to younger age groups. Establishing a uniform order would enhance reader comprehension. If it helps, incorporating icons and increased contrast could aid in clearer data interpretation. If all charts are presented all at once, I also think maintaining color consistency is important. Chart 1 and 2 seem to utilize a different color palette than Chart 3 and 4, and aligning these choices would contribute to a more cohesive visual experience.
6. Chart No. 1 works best for me; the components are organized more cohesively than the others, aiding in intuitive reading. I appreciate the additional line element to highlight the total increase percentage. I think it's really helpful for users to grasp the extent of the changing trend more easily.
7. For contrast, Charts 3 and 4 are effective, but the color selection is quite stereotypical, representing women with pink and men with blue. 😄
8. think "The Rise of Never Married Adults" one would grab attention more quickly because it states the 'issue' at the beginning.
   

**adult, late 50's**

1. This is an info that adult never married across all age grups in USA rises from 2006 to 2016.
2. Adult men that never married tends to much  higher than that of women across all age groups in USA from 2006 to 2016. 
3. Surpringly start from the age group of 35 and above the percentage of men and women never married are getting lower. It means at the age of 35 and above men and women in usa from 2006 to 2016 in all age group tend to get married.
4. This is to induce young generation not to neglect marriage because of their business.
5. May be I can make a different graph but I need some times to think.
6.The first one. Because all info required are depicted within the picture without neccessary to look at the legend (notes) below the graph.
Easy to read and digest.
7. The first graph as the color are bold to distinguish the age grups
8. The first one has delivered all info required and easy to digest


These are their list of feedbacks that i got. After i received it, then i tried to question myself,

**What patterns in the feedback emerge? What did you learn from the feedback?**

1. Everyone seems to actually portray the same meaning after immediately seeing the sketches, so the sketches tend to be understandable
2. Everyone seems to actually can deliver the same description after immediately seeing the sketches
3. The third and four sketches somewhat can be interesting and confusing for some people, because it is reversed by trend and also years
4. Mostly answered public, also people who neglect marriage because some other business or work
5. Better to be consistent between sketches, but i intentionally did this to see which order more make sense, and most of them see sketches 1 and 2 more make sense with the headline and the context (different than the original image order)
6. the first sketch  tend to make more sense since the rising make more sense and also it is easily to navigate. The components are organized more cohesively than the others, aiding in intuitive reading. Because all info required are depicted within the picture without neccessary to look at the legend (notes) below the graph.
Easy to read and digest.
7. As for the color it looks like a tie, but i think the third and four sketch has more contrast color which is more great to segment gender
8. All agreed on The rise of never married adults both men and women

So i will do the improvement based on these feedbacks i got, i used these feedback from this step to guide my final redesign. Also i will try to go back to MakeoverMonday and view some redesigns. But my video only have a tableau tutorial without a critique video competitions like some others graphic choices. Eventhough, i still tried to watch several of other graphic contents that the presenter will critique about its data visualizations that were created as part of the redesign challenge, these videos actually influence me to do most of ideas for sketches, since the sketch i create are more than 1,, and also the final solution.


# Step 5 : Build your solution

For this final step, i tried to implement the feedback that i received for my proposed solution, also already modified and designed the solution using tableau tools.

## Final Solution

 vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

In this sketching, i try to redesign the visualization to portray it according to the feedback that the assesment result gives below :

1. i try to make it to be consistent between sketches, but i intentionally did this to see which order more make sense, and most of them see sketches 1 and 2 more make sense with the headline and the context (different than the original image order)
2. The first sketch tend to make more sense since the rising make more sense and also it is easily to navigate. The components are organized more cohesively than the others, aiding in intuitive reading. Because all info required are depicted within the picture without neccessary to look at the legend (notes) below the graph.
Easy to read and digest.
3. As for the color it looks like a tie, but i think the third and four sketch has more contrast color which is more great to segment gender (pink and blue)
4. All agreed on The rise of never married adults both men and women
   
**Change of Colors :** For this sketch I try to use the colors feedback that i gathered from 4 people and it has pretty much the same pattern of agreement, these colors seem to be more appealing and easy to navigate segmentations of gender. I change it to light blue, blue, light pink, and pink as discussed above in the feedback section. I also change the headline colors to make it easy to understand and correlate between the headline and the graph.

**Change of Headlines :** I try to to change the headlin to "THE RISE OF NEVER MARRIED ADULTS BOTH WOMEN AND MEN IN THE U.S IN FROM 2006 TO 2016" to actually says the word rise as intended for the readers and it make more sense to put it according to the feedback as well.

**Change of Brief Explanation :** I try to change this one to make more clarity of what the graph and bar line in the graph, because it enhance the intuition and perception more clearer, "The increment change of never married adults percentage from 2006 to 2016,  showed in small bar percentage ".

**Change of Graph View Orientation :** In this graph i mostly use bar charts with horizontal view as per the sketch 1 since all the components are there and easily read this way, it is also really great to portray the segmentation between gender and also the rise can be seen as well.

As for me personally this chart really creates a great impression of story to tell the audience of THE RISE OF NEVER MARRIED ADULTS BOTH WOMEN AND MEN IN THE U.S IN FROM 2006 TO 2016
and directly shown the increment change of never married adults percentage from 2006 to 2016, that showed in small bar percentage, which is a really great additional information which can make people intuitively make sense of the graph. All components are established bautifully and appealing as well. The source already there as well to make sure of the validity of the data. In my opinion the redesign is more clearer and easy to navigate than the original one.
