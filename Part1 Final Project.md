# Part 1: Final Project

## Brilian Pracoyo Adi (badi@andrew.cmu.edu)

# Outline

## High Level Sumamary

In my final project, I will bring the topic about Earth Hour which is a global movement initiative that aims to reduce global energy consumption in this case electricity consumption, by turning light off for 1 hour long worldwide while making it as a symbol to increase people awareness about important environmental issues such as climate change. As we know, Climate change is a significant and long-term shifts in global climate patterns. These changes primarily resulted from the emission of greenhouse gases such as Carbon dioxide (CO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen oxides (NOx),Particulate matter (PM), Heavy metals such as mercury into the atmosphere. 

In 2021, approximately 61% of the electricity generated in the United States was produced by plants burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as biomass, and municipal and industrial wastes. When these fuels are burned, they emit various gases and pollutants, contributing to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. This heightened concentration intensifies the greenhouse effect, which traps heat and leads to a rise in the Earth's average temperature.[1]

The consequences of climate change include rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, more frequent and severe weather events (such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods), melting glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels, shifts in ecosystems and habitats, and impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human health. 

My final project will utilizes data visualization to depict energy consumption and electricity generation trends over time and across regions, highlighting the environmental impact of these activities, notably the emission of greenhouse gases. Key statistics on carbon emissions, energy usage, and environmental degradation are visually represented.

Additionally, my project will include an infographic showcasing the environmental benefits milestones from Earth Hour Initiatives, emphasizing its significance in addressing climate change. My aim is to provide creative ways of actionable steps for students, especially information systems students at Carnegie Mellon University to contribute to energy conservation efforts in various unique ways, aiming to inspire them to engage in Earth Hour initiatives and take proactive measures to combat climate change.

The graph depicting global primary energy consumption reveals a consistent annual increase across different forms of energy, including electricity and heat. Notably, countries such as China, India, Indonesia, the United States, and the global aggregate all show significant rises in energy consumption over time.

further in my analysis and opinion :

China's surge in energy demand is closely tied to its rapid industrial and urban development, catering to the needs of its expanding economy and population. Similarly, India's growing energy consumption is driven by factors like population growth, urbanization, and industrial expansion as it strives for economic progress.

Indonesia, as a developing nation, exhibits a rising energy consumption trend as it endeavors to meet the needs of its growing population and support economic development. Meanwhile, the United States, a major energy consumer, continues to see steady increases in energy usage due to economic activity, population growth, and technological advancements.

The global curve represents the combined trajectory of energy consumption worldwide, reflecting the interconnected nature of economies and the universal reliance on energy for various purposes. Despite efforts to promote energy efficiency and transition to renewable sources, the persistent growth in energy consumption underscores the ongoing challenge of balancing energy demands with environmental sustainability.

below is the geographic map version of the data above, which can emphasize more on the energy consumption per countries.

### The Problem

Energy production is vital for modern life, but a significant portion of it relies on sources that release harmful gases into the atmosphere. These gases are major contributors to the ongoing climate crisis we are facing.

When power plants burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as biomass or municipal and industrial wastes, they emit a range of gases and toxins. Among these pollutants are carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and heavy metals. Each of these byproducts has negative impacts on the environment. For instance, CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. SO2 emissions can lead to acid rain, which harms ecosystems, plants, and animals.

The level of our energy consumption directly affects the amount of emissions released into the environment. The more energy we use, the more electricity plants need to produce to meet our demands, resulting in higher emissions of these harmful gases and pollutants. In the United States, for example, the majority of electricity generation in 2021 came from plants burning fossil fuels and other sources, amplifying the environmental impact of our energy consumption.

To put it into perspective, in 2017, approximately 28% of total global emissions were attributed to electricity generation, making it the second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions after transportation, which accounted for 29%. This highlights the significant role of energy production in exacerbating climate change and environmental degradation. [2]

Therefore, it is essential to recognize the connection between our energy consumption and its environmental consequences. By making conscious choices to reduce our energy usage, transition to cleaner energy sources, and support sustainable practices, we can all play a part in mitigating the negative impacts of energy production on the environment and combating climate change.

Below are the graphs of the amount of Fossil Fuel Combustion Carbon dioxide and also other gasses that been address per 5 years :

The amounts are big so in that case this is a serious problem that we need to solve in order to fight climate change and make our earth safe, iin that case we need a call to action, and as students, we can participate to fight this in different ways, but first its good to know what Earth Hour and its initiative, and how we can be a part of it and emphasize the initiative with our own way.

### Call to Action

#### Earth Hour and its Milestone

Earth Hour is a really positive and impactful event that happens once a year, usually at the end of March. It's organized by a group called the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). During Earth Hour, people all around the world turn off unnecessary lights and appliances for just one hour, from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. local time.
The point of Earth Hour is to raise awareness about important environmental issues, especially climate change. By switching off lights and saving electricity for that one hour, we show that even small actions can make a big difference in helping the planet

But Earth Hour isn't just about turning off lights. It's also about encouraging everyone to think about how they use energy every day and how they can do it in a more eco-friendly way. It's like a reminder to be more mindful of the environment and to try to use resources wisely.

What's really awesome about Earth Hour is that it brings people together from all over the world. Millions of people take part, showing that we all care about the planet and want to work together to protect it. Whether you're in a big city or a small town, participating in Earth Hour can make you feel like you're part of a global team that's making a positive impact.

Earth Hour is not just about turning off lights—it's about raising awareness, promoting sustainable habits, and joining forces to make the world a better place for everyone.

#### How Can We Contribute as a Student

For the **audience of information systems students,** I believe there are numerous ways we can contribute to addressing climate change and environmental issues. Here are some potential actions that we can consider:

Firstly, we can actively participate in initiatives such as turning off lights for designated periods, either annually or nightly. This small effort can collectively reduce energy consumption, which is a significant driver of climate change.

Secondly, we can focus on developing sustainable information systems. By designing and implementing software applications that prioritize energy efficiency, resource management, and the adoption of renewable energy sources, we can contribute to reducing environmental impacts.

Additionally, our skills in data analysis and visualization can be valuable in monitoring environmental parameters. Through the analysis of environmental data such as air and water quality measurements, climate data, and satellite imagery, we can uncover insights that inform decision-making processes and aid in understanding environmental issues.

Innovative technologies for environmental monitoring, such as sensor networks, drones, and IoT devices, present another avenue for contribution. By developing these tools, we can enhance the effectiveness of environmental monitoring and data collection efforts.

These are just a few examples of how information systems students can make a meaningful impact in addressing climate change and environmental challenges. With creativity and dedication, there are countless opportunities for us to contribute to a sustainable future.

# Method and medium

My final project will be created using Tableau for data visualization and Shorthand for storytelling. I will utilize Tableau to generate interactive visualizations depicting energy consumption patterns, carbon emissions data, electricity generation data, and other relevant data to create a better presentation. I will also utilize Shorthand as the platform for presenting my story telling narrative, integrating data visualizations with explanatory text and multimedia elements. My final presentation deck I hope will enable students to engage with the content and gain a deeper understanding and awareness of environmental issues and the importance of sustainable practices in the future.
