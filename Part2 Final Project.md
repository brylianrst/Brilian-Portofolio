# Part 2: Final Project

## Brilian Pracoyo Adi (badi@andrew.cmu.edu)

# Wireframes / Storyboards

Student has created a storyboard that lays out the necessary progression through sketches and / or wireframes for their project. The sketches are high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of the story. The outline of the story is clear, and the data visualizations appear to fit well in the context of the outline. 
There are a sufficient number of data visualizations and they provide a good summary of the story the student wishes to tell. Information is logically presented and easy to follow. Sketches and/or prototypes and scenarios of use bring opportunity areas to life.

Data visualizations are identified, and sketches include examples of how the real data might be rendered. Data visualizations are appropriate for the project, and of sufficient quantity and quality to tell a compelling story. Important elements like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used 
appropriately.

New Github page created within existing repository. Navigation exists that takes the reader between other parts of the final project and back to the main portfolio. Progress is documented in the new markdown file, and includes relevant sections (wireframes and storyboards, user research and interviews, etc.)
