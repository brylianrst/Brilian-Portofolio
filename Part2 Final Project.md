# Part 2: Final Project

## Brilian Pracoyo Adi (badi@andrew.cmu.edu)

I already created a new Github page within my existing repository. I also put navigation that takes the reader between other parts of the final project and back to the main portfolio. 
And finally, documented my progress of the project here in the new markdown file and includes relevant sections (wireframes and storyboards, user research and interviews, etc.)

# Wireframes / Storyboards

My journey of creating the wireframes / storyboards takes time around 1-3 days, fully thinking about how to refine the story lines from the last project part and how to add more things in the outline or storyboard narrative structure, in other words, i was thinking how to elaborate content and its structure to tell a compelling story.

I write down my thoughts and try to refine my structure in word doc for these past days, then i immediately shift it to the shorthand app. I find that shorthand is really useful to create a compelling story and presentation. but it gets laggy when there are more wireframes and moving background, so it does take longer time to write and manage everything.

The endless features it brings me to explore my creativity with limitless possibilities, it really interest me to be able to create a compelling story with my own choice of mood boards, background theme, transitions, text placement and style.

In this project, i used two tools as my main weapons :

first, i use tableau, all the data visualizations on my shorthand presentation is created by me with the data sources from links that i had listed on my part 1 project submisson github.

second, i use shorthand, i find it as a really great tool to create persuasive, aestethic, and compelling story telling deck presentation. Also i find it easy to use, took couple of hours(around 1-3 hours) to learn the tool, but the deck / wireframes itself took 2-3 days to complete, here is my link to this project : [Shorthand Link](https://preview.shorthand.com/bxIgmhZoF9xY8buF)

I have developed a shorthand presentation containing a storyboard that lays out the necessary progression through sketches and / or wireframes for this project. The sketches/wireframes that i provided are high-fidelity, and also for the data visualizations i already provided individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of the story. The outline of the story is clear, and the data visualizations appear to fit well in the context of the outline. There are a sufficient number of data visualizations and they provide a good summary of the story that i wish to tell. Information is logically presented and easy to follow. Sketches and/or wireframes and scenarios of use bring opportunity areas to life especially the call to action for students that can bring opportunity to really participate and know what activities to do in order to participate.

Also i already indentify the data visualizations and sketches, include examples of how the real data might be rendered. Data visualizations that i provide are appropriate for the project and of sufficient quantity and quality to tell a compelling story. I also already referenced and used important elements like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements appropriately for the data visualizations.

# User Research Protocol

I have created a simple user research protocol that describes what the goal of my research is, including the questions i intended to ask my interviewees by showing my early wireframes / storyboards to at least three different individuals. 

The protocol i made already include details of who is the target audience, what approach to identifying representative individuals to interview that i will use, the interview script.

#### My User Research Protocol Will Clearly Identify the Following:

#### A. The target audience I hope to reach with my story
#### B. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
#### C. My interview script
 
## Target audience I hope to reach with my story

Since my topic emphasize on suggesting various ways for students from general background or general public to contribute reducing climate change through participating earth hour initiatives, this user research target audience will also be students from general background or general public.

After defining and knowing my target audience, i tried to think and breakdown what approach i need to use to identify representative individuals and who to reach with my story during my interviews. I finally decided to breakdown my approach into something like below.

## My approach to identifying representative individuals

To make sure of the validity and relevance of the user research for my project targeting students from general backgrounds, I created a strategic approach to identifying representative individuals to interview. Here's how I plan to do it:

### Define Target Demographics

I will first define the demographic characteristics of students that align with my target audience. This may include factors such as age range, educational background, specific areas of interest field, and their availability to be interviewed.

**Academic Background:**
I will verify that the individuals are currently enrolled in or recently graduated from university, within any major, because the aim is for general students.

**Areas of Interest:**
I will try to determine the specific areas of interest within the field that align with my project, such as sustainable environment, sustainable energy, etc. But this is not mandatory since in my opinion almost everyone supposed to want to help make our environment to be less harmful.

**Availability and Accessibility:**
I will make sure that the individuals are available and willing to participate in the interview process within mydesignated timeframe. Consider factors such as scheduling conflicts, geographic location (if conducting in-person interviews), and accessibility needs.

### Ask colleagues that we have worked together from many Courses at CMU (which match the demographic criteria).

I will look into my friends from various courses or backgrounds in CMU since this aim for general background students.

### Ask friends from my Indonesian CMU Student Organizations (which match the demographic criteria).

I will try to leverage my Indonesian Student Organization friends and networks within CMU. They are really helpful and as well many have diverse backgrounds and also studying at CMU.

## Interview script

I already created interview script with list of 5-7 questions to get a meaningful feedback and insights from the interviewees, 
I try to come up with the most valuable and important questions to ask, since at first i created 15-20 questions and i think those are 
too much and kinda overwhelmed the interviewees, so in that case i try to minimize the numbers and come with the most important questions 
that i think can emphasize and help refine my shorthand storyboards in terms of context, structure, data visualizations, wireframes, etc.

> List of goals from my research, and the questions I intend to ask the interviewees.

### Goal: Get Ideas of Audience General Understanding About my Story/Context

#### General Understanding

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

### Goal: Finding Insight to Enhance Storyboards Structure (The Presentation Story Structure)

#### Storyboards Structure (The Presentation Story Structure)

- What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling

### Goal: Get Ideas On How to Enhance Wireframes (each slides/content that build the presentation)

#### Wireframes (each slides/content that build the presentation)

- Is the progression through wireframes already great ?

### Goal: Finding Insight to Enhance Data Visualization (Graphics)

#### Data Visualizations

- Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
- Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?


## Interview Findings / User Findings

I already completed interviewing five people. These interviewees are ranging from student 24-34's, but i already remove all PII and any sensitive information.

I already documented the findings from the interviews, including specific insights and observations, key quotes and other learnings. 
 
> Detail the findings from my interviews.

### (Student, mid 20's)

#### Can you tell me what you think this is?
Article about climate change due to massive energy consumption

#### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Policy maker, scientist in the field of energy, country leaders, individual

#### What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling? 
It's very text heavy article, you could add more visual or highlight important points to help reader grasp the idea

#### Is the progression through wireframes already great ? 
Yeah but I'm not sure why you suddenly focus on US gas emission because at the beginning we discussed about the world and top countries that consume/generate a lot of energy. maybe you could keep the focus on global or just choose specific countries consistenly

#### Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
I think you can add visual about impact of earth hour

#### Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?
The size on the shorthand is small, so it's pretty hard to see and a lot of the axis writing gets cut off. It's better if you're consistent in using the colors too

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### (Student, late 20s)

#### Can you tell me what you think this is?
A website campaigning earth hour

#### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
General audience, people who care about environment

#### What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling? 
Structure is OK and compelling, however the content is too long so it’s hard to follow along and understand the gist of the topic

#### Is the progression through wireframes already great ? 
Yes, the progression already clear and smooth

#### Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
Yes, its enough to tell a compelling story

#### Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?
Yes, the elements in the visuals already use clear annotations, legends, captions, data source appropriately

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### (Student, early 30s)

#### Can you tell me what you think this is?
A call to save the earth

#### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
General public

#### What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling? 
Good structure that shows the actions and consequences

#### Is the progression through wireframes already great ? 
Yes the progression is already good, but the number of text on each slide/wireframe should be reduce,

#### Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
Yes, its sufficient to tell a compelling story

#### Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?
Some charts need a data label on it to show the actual numbers since it is depicted in quite a big scale (terawatts)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### (Student, mid 30s)

#### Can you tell me what you think this is?
This is a presentation how as a student to help preventing and reducing climate change.

#### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Everyone but specially students

#### What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling? 
It is good since the slides are easily to understand

#### Can you tell me what you think this is?
An advertisement to advocate people to help save the environment.

#### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Everyone?.

#### What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling? 
Yes, it is a good way to tell story. The background picture is very impressive, there’re also many graphs help explain. Maybe a story line at the front of page may help people to understand the whole structure better.

#### Is the progression through wireframes already great ? 
The design of the graphs is compatible and ease to the eye

#### Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
I think so. There’re data from different countries and different angles.

#### Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?
Yes, no need to improve since it's already clear.

# Identified Changes for Part III

I already identified what changes that I plan on implementing for Part III based on the feedback to address any issues raised in the user research or interview feedbacks.

> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

## Findings or observations from interviews

From my interviews conducted with five people, i higlighted several comments and critique that can be use for further improvements, here are the highlights :

### - It's very text heavy article, you could add more visual or highlight important points to help reader grasp the idea

### - Yeah but I'm not sure why you suddenly focus on US gas emission because at the beginning we discussed about the world and top countries that consume/generate a lot of energy. maybe you could keep the focus on global or just choose specific countries consistenly

### - I think you can add visual about impact of earth hour

### - The size on the shorthand is small, so it's pretty hard to see and a lot of the axis writing gets cut off. It's better if you're consistent in using the colors too

### - Structure is OK and compelling, however the content is too long so it’s hard to follow along and understand the gist of the topic

### - Yes the progression is already good, but the number of text on each slide/wireframe should be reduce,

### - Some charts need a data label on it to show the actual numbers since it is depicted in quite a big scale (terawatts)

### - Maybe a story line at the front of page may help people to understand the whole structure better.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Changes That I Will Implement for The Final Deliverables

Based on the feedback provided by the interviewees, I will create a list of changes that I could implement to improve my final project deliverables :

### - I will try to incorporate more visuals such as images related to the content and try to break up the text-heavy content and highlight important points. Reducing the amount of text on each slide or wireframe to improve readability and comprehension.

### - I will keep maintaining consistency in focus throughout the storyboards, either keeping it focusing on global or focusing on specific countries consistently.

### - I will add more visuals illustrating the impact of Earth Hour to make the concept more tangible for readers.

### - Increase the font size and ensure that all text is clearly visible, especially on charts and graphs where axis labels may get cut off.

### - I will use more consistent colors throughout the project for better visual coherence.

### - Streamlining the content to make it more concise and easier for readers to follow along and grasp the main idea.

### - I will include data labels for the actual numbers, especially when depicting data on a large scale such as terawatts.

### - I will plan to consider giving a story line at the front of page may help people to understand the whole structure better.

I will elaborate more during the journey working on the part III, some of these points i already tried to fix, i just want to write these in this github page since these are my thoughts on what can be improve and what are the focus, by implementing these changes, I think i can enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of my final project deliverables and create a much better wireframes, storyboards that can help me on the final presentation.

# Moodboards / personas

I already did this in the shorthand link, I tried to make the tone, background, theme, and mood related to the topic of climate change environment, etc. I find it as a really great tool to create persuasive, aestethic, and compelling story telling deck presentation that can emphasize audience mood as well. it took me couple of days create it, here is my link to this project : [Shorthand Link](https://preview.shorthand.com/bxIgmhZoF9xY8buF)
