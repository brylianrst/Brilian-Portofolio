# Part 2: Final Project

## Brilian Pracoyo Adi (badi@andrew.cmu.edu)

I already created a new Github page within my existing repository. I also put navigation that takes the reader between other parts of the final project and back to the main portfolio. 
And finally, documented my progress of the project here in the new markdown file and includes relevant sections (wireframes and storyboards, user research and interviews, etc.)

# Wireframes / Storyboards

My journey of creating the wireframes / storyboards takes time around 1-3 days, fully thinking about how to refine the story lines from the last project part and how to add more things in the outline or storyboard narrative structure, in other words, i was thinking how to elaborate content and its structure to tell a compelling story.

I write down my thoughts and try to refine my structure in word doc for these past days, then i immediately shift it to the shorthand app. I find that shorthand is really useful to create a compelling story and presentation.

The endless features it brings me to explore my creativity with limitless possibilities, it really interest me to be able to create a compelling story with my own choice of mood boards, background theme, transitions, text placement and style.

In this project, i used two tools as my main weapons :

first, i use tableau, all the data visualizations on my shorthand presentation is created by me with the data sources from links that i had listed on my part 1 project submisson github.

second, i use shorthand, i find it as a really great tool to create persuasive, aestethic, and compelling story telling deck presentation. Also i find it easy to use, took couple of hours(around 1-3 hours) to learn the tool, but the deck / wireframes itself took 2-3 days to complete, here is my link to this project : [Shorthand Link](https://preview.shorthand.com/bxIgmhZoF9xY8buF)

I have developed a shorthand presentation containing a storyboard that lays out the necessary progression through sketches and / or wireframes for this project. The sketches/wireframes that i provided are high-fidelity, and also for the data visualizations i already provided individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of the story. The outline of the story is clear, and the data visualizations appear to fit well in the context of the outline. There are a sufficient number of data visualizations and they provide a good summary of the story that i wish to tell. Information is logically presented and easy to follow. Sketches and/or wireframes and scenarios of use bring opportunity areas to life especially the call to action for information systems student that can bring opportunity to really participate and know what activities to do in order to participate.

Also i already indentify the data visualizations and sketches, include examples of how the real data might be rendered. Data visualizations that i provide are appropriate for the project and of sufficient quantity and quality to tell a compelling story. I also already referenced and used important elements like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements appropriately for the data visualizations.

# User Research Protocol

I have created a simple user research protocol that describes what the goal of my research is, including the questions i intended to ask my interviewees by showing my early wireframes / storyboards to at least three different individuals. 

The protocol i made already include details of who is the target audience, what approach to identifying representative individuals to interview that i will use, the interview script.

### My User Research Protocol Will Clearly Identify the Following:

### A. The target audience you hope to reach with your story**
### B. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview**
### C. My interview script**
 
## Target Audience

Since my topic emphasize on suggesting various ways for tech students to contribute reducing climate change through participating earth hour initiatives, this user research target audience will also be tech students. 

After defining and knowing my target audience, i tried to think and breakdown what approach i need to use to identify representative individuals and who to reach with my story during my interviews. I finally decided to breakdown my approach into something like below.

## My Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals

To ensure the validity and relevance of the user research for my project targeting tech students, I will employ a strategic approach to identifying representative individuals to interview. Here's how I plan to do it:

### Define Target Demographics

I will first define the demographic characteristics of tech students that align with my target audience. This may include factors such as age range, educational background,specific areas of interest within the tech field, and their availability to be interviewed.

**Academic Background:**
Verify that the individuals are currently enrolled in or recently graduated from a technology-related program, such as computer science, engineering, information technology, or a related field.

**Areas of Interest:**
Determine the specific areas of interest within the tech field that align with your project. This could include software development, cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, user experience design, or other specialized domains.

**Availability and Accessibility:**
Ensure that the individuals are available and willing to participate in the interview process within your designated timeframe. Consider factors such as scheduling conflicts, geographic location (if conducting in-person interviews), and accessibility needs.\

### Ask Friends/Colleagues that we have worked together from many Tech Courses at CMU (Which match the demographic criteria).

I will leverage my friends from Tech Courses in CMU This could include friends from computer science courses, Information Systems Courses, or other relevant tech courses.

### Ask Friends from My Indonesian CMU Student Organizations (Which match the demographic criteria).

I will leverage my Indonesian Student Organization friends and networks within CMU. They are really helpful and as well many have tech backgrounds and also studying in tech majors at CMU.

## Interview script

I already created interview script with list of 7-8 questions to get a meaningful feedback and insights from the interviewees, 
I try to come up with the most valuable and important questions to ask, since at first i created 15-20 questions and i think those are 
too much and kinda overwhelmed the interviewees, so in that case i try to minimize the numbers and come with the most important questions 
that i think can emphasize and help refine my shorthand storyboards in terms of context, structure, data visualizations, wireframes, etc.

> List of goals from my research, and the questions I intend to ask the interviewees.

### Goal: Get Ideas of Audience General Understanding About my Story/Context

- Can you tell me what you think this is? 
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

### Goal: Finding Insight to Enhance Storyboards Structure (The Presentation Story Structure)

- What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling? Is the message delivered and clearly understood ? 
- Is there any suggestions you would like to provide regarding storyboards structure ?

### Goal: Get Ideas On How to Enhance Wireframes (each slides/content that build the presentation)

- Is the progression through wireframes already great ? Is there any suggestions you would like to provide regarding the content and slides ?

### Goal: Finding Insight to Enhance Data Visualization (Graphics)

- Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
- Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ? Is there any suggestions for improving the data visualization ?


## Interview Findings

I already completed interviewing three people. These interviewees are ranging from student 23-30's, but i already remove all PII and any sensitive information.

I already documented the findings from the interviews, including specific insights and observations, key quotes and other learnings. 
 
> Detail the findings from my interviews.

### (Student, 24)

### General Understanding

#### Can you tell me what you think this is?
article about climate change due to massive energy consumption

#### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
policy maker, scientist in the field of energy, country leaders, individual

### Storyboards Structure (The Presentation Story Structure)

### What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling? 
it's very text heavy article, you could add more visual or highlight important points to help reader grasp the idea

### Wireframes (each slides/content that build the presentation)

#### Is the progression through wireframes already great ? 
yeah but I'm not sure why you suddenly focus on US gas emission padahal di awal discuss about the world and top countries yang consume/generate bnyk energy. maybe you could keep the focus on global or just choose specific countries consistenly

### Data Visualization (Graphics)

#### Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
I think you can add visual about impact of earth hour

#### Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?
size di shorthand kecil, jadi susah liatnya dan banyak tulisan axis kepotong
better kalo consistent in using the colors too

# Moodboards / personas
> If you did this optional part, include details here.  Otherwise remove this section

I already did this in the shorthand link, I tried to make the tone, background, theme, and mood related to the topic of climate change environment, etc.  i find it as a really great tool to create persuasive, aestethic, and compelling story telling deck presentation that can emphasize audience mood as well. it took me couple of days create it, here is my link to this project : [Shorthand Link](https://preview.shorthand.com/bxIgmhZoF9xY8buF)
