# Part 3: Final Project

## Brilian Pracoyo Adi (badi@andrew.cmu.edu)

I already created a new Github page within my existing repository for this final project part 3. I also put navigation that takes the reader between other parts of the final project 
and back to the main portfolio. And finally, documented my progress of the project here in the new markdown file and includes relevant sections (wireframes and storyboards, user research and interviews, etc.)

# The final data story

Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  
Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  
Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

## A final data story / report on Shorthand (or similar platform you proposed in Part I).

I Included a link to my final data story on Shorthand here :

## A final writeup for Part III that summarizes all my work thus far to create my final project. 

In my final project, I will bring the topic about Earth Hour which is a global movement initiative that aims to reduce global energy consumption in this case electricity consumption, by turning light off for 1 hour long worldwide while making it as a symbol to increase people awareness about important environmental issues such as climate change. As we know, Climate change is a significant and long-term shifts in global climate patterns. These changes primarily resulted from the emission of greenhouse gases such as Carbon dioxide (CO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen oxides (NOx),Particulate matter (PM), Heavy metals such as mercury into the atmosphere.

In 2021, approximately 61% of the electricity generated in the United States was produced by plants burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as biomass, and municipal and industrial wastes. When these fuels are burned, they emit various gases and pollutants, contributing to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. This heightened concentration intensifies the greenhouse effect, which traps heat and leads to a rise in the Earth’s average temperature.[1]

The consequences of climate change include rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, more frequent and severe weather events (such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods), melting glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels, shifts in ecosystems and habitats, and impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human health.

My final project will utilizes data visualization to depict energy consumption and electricity generation trends over time and across regions, highlighting the environmental impact of these activities, notably the emission of greenhouse gases. Key statistics on carbon emissions, energy usage, and environmental degradation are visually represented.

Additionally, my project will include an infographic showcasing the environmental benefits milestones from Earth Hour Initiatives, emphasizing its significance in addressing climate change. My aim is to provide creative ways of actionable steps for students, especially information systems students at Carnegie Mellon University to contribute to energy conservation efforts in various unique ways, aiming to inspire them to engage in Earth Hour initiatives and take proactive measures to combat climate change.

# References
You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story - if so, you can probably skip this section. Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If you do this, you probably want to include a link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren’t using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story. Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

# Final thoughts
You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don’t fit well in the previous sections here. How did it go? What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit? What were you most excited about? Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process. If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.

By the end of Part III, your final deliverable should be complete and publicly accessible as a digital asset (e.g. you've published your story on Shorthand, etc.).  
You will also have a writeup on Github that summarizes your work done in the final week as outlined below.  Finally, you should have also completed your presentation during class. 

A Word document that includes the text for your final report submitted through TurnItIn. 
A presentation given on your final data story / report during class. 

(Hey!  These next two bullets are important!  You're creating a publicly-accessible website, so take the time to make sure you're citing your materials correctly.  
If you're unfamiliar with what a copyright is or how to cite materials, please see the library's guide.  
This helps protect you from potential issues around copyright violations and academic integrity issues related to plagiarism.)

Include all references for materials used.  It's your responsibility to ensure you have permission to use imagery and other assets, and that you use them appropriately.  
A reminder to NOT USE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - see the library's guide to ensure you are using images correctly.  
Make sure to add / update any citations and / or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.  
References should also be clearly identified on your final data story itself.  Review the library's guide if you have questions. 

Final reminder: your final project pages for Part I, II and III be linked together and should include links / references to everything you've used. 
Once you are finished with your project and feel you're ready to submit your work, copy and paste the text from your story (e.g. from Shorthand, ArcGIS Story Maps) into a new Word document.  
Review the TurnItIn results - if TurnItIn flags any issues, you should fix these issues before submitting your final work. Submit your Word document along with the link to your final project.

Github page(s) for final project is complete, well organized and summarizes all the work done thus far. Provides behind the scenes look at how the work was created for Part III. 
Link to Github repository (portfolio page) and the final publicly available Shorthand (or other acceptable site) is included. Other information as relevant / needed included in the Part III writeup.

Images are cited correctly, follow library guidelines on acceptable use. Links working. Final page includes all links / references for everything used in project. 
Citations are detailed enough to easily track back to original sources.

Part III writeup includes a few paragraphs that talk about the intended audience, personas if used, and changes made with the audience in mind.

A few paragraphs summarizing work, design decisions and observations.

Embedded visualizations working correctly and appear appropriate for the audience. Colors support understanding of the information and don't distract from the message. 
Other elements work with the overall deliverable, not against it. Data visualizations are easy to interpret and understand.

The final deliverable is well written and seems appropriate for the audience. The content appears to reinforce the correct interpretation of the data visualizations. 
The Word document has been submitted and issues identified by TurnItIn have been addressed.

All elements seem to work together seamlessly. The project feels complete and is not missing elements. 
Other supporting elements (citations, references, interactions, animations) appear to be working correctly.

For the final data story, i'm thinking of creating a summary of my journey from creating part 1,2 until this part 3.

NOTE: You don't need to re-write or recreate content that i have already created for part I and II of this assignment
The writeup for the final project on Github should serve as a kind of "behind the scenes" look at how you created your work.  
When reviewing Part III of your final assignment, I should be able to clearly follow along in your progress - noting how you used everything you've created in 
Part I and Part II to develop your final project.
