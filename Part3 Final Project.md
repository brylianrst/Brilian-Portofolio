# Part 3: Final Project

## Brilian Pracoyo Adi (badi@andrew.cmu.edu)

I already created a new Github page within my existing repository for this final project part 3. I also put navigation that takes the reader between other parts of the final project and back to the main portfolio. And finally, documented my progress of the project here in the new markdown file and includes relevant sections (wireframes and storyboards, user research and interviews, etc.)

# The final data story

in this page, I have Included any other information i used that helped me for building the story, data, and narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.) 

## A final data story / report on Shorthand (or similar platform you proposed in Part I).

I Included a link to my final data story on Shorthand here :
[Shorthand Link](https://preview.shorthand.com/OcvvIO8KW2GZtx24#group-section-Climate-Change-E81tPh23Qk)

## A final writeup for Part III that summarizes all my work thus far to create my final project. 

### Summary of Journey Creating Part I
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The journey of creating my final project starts with my initial part, part 1. When i did the part 1, the whole amount of time i used to work on the part is mostly used to think about what kinda topic is really suitable to be presented in the class and have really great call to action, also thinking thoroughly about the structure breakdown to make it story-able.

I decided to brought up the topic about Earth Hour as the answer to climate change, for people who are not familiar, Earth hour is a global movement initiative that aims to answer climate change issue by aspiring people to turn light off for 1 hour long worldwide while making it as a symbol to increase people awareness about important environmental issues such as climate change.

As we know, Climate change is a significant and long-term shifts in global climate patterns. These changes primarily resulted from the emission of greenhouse gases such as Carbon dioxide (CO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen oxides (NOx),Particulate matter (PM), Heavy metals such as mercury into the atmosphere. In 2021, approximately 61% of the electricity generated in the United States was produced by plants burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as biomass, and municipal and industrial wastes. When these fuels are burned, they emit various gases and pollutants, contributing to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. This heightened concentration intensifies the greenhouse effect, which traps heat and leads to a rise in the Earth’s average temperature. The consequences of climate change include rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, more frequent and severe weather events (such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods), melting glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels, shifts in ecosystems and habitats, and impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human health.

I decided to pick this topic for telling stories with data because I think that environmental concern is well acknowledge by many people, and it could really open awarness to the audience about the importance of saving our world trough actively participating in a positive movement such as Earth Hour. I also had an undergraduate degree from electrical engineering, which back then i'm surrounded by this kind of topic and issue.

I utilized data visualization to depict world energy consumption and electricity generation trends over time, highlighting the environmental impact of these activities, notably the emission of greenhouse gasses. Key statistics on carbon emissions, energy usage, and environmental degradation are visually represented.

Also I included an infographic showcasing the environmental benefits milestones from Earth Hour Initiatives, emphasizing its significance in addressing climate change. My aim is to provide creative ways of actionable steps for students, especially information systems students at Carnegie Mellon University to contribute to energy conservation efforts in various unique ways, aiming to inspire them to engage in Earth Hour initiatives and take proactive measures to combat climate change.

Also already referenced or put list of data that i used in the creation of part I : 
I have been searching all over the internet across government, industry, and global outlook websites etc to find data sources that related to climate change, energy generation, energy consumption, electricity generation, electricity consumption, gas emission, global greenhouse, CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and many other things related to the affect of energy generation and consumption towards climate change.

These are list of links to the publicly-accessible datasets that I plan to use for this final project.

CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions

My final project will be created using Tableau for data visualization and Shorthand for storytelling. I will utilize Tableau to generate interactive visualizations depicting energy consumption patterns, carbon emissions data, electricity generation data, and other relevant data to create a better presentation. I will also utilize Shorthand as the platform for presenting my story telling narrative, integrating data visualizations with explanatory text and multimedia elements. My final presentation deck I hope will enable students to engage with the content and gain a deeper understanding and awareness of environmental issues and the importance of sustainable practices in the future.

### Summary of Journey Creating Part II
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Note:** The modification or changes that i made tranistioning from part I to part II was the target audience that i chose. I was thinking along the journey that the audience for this part was actually to niche and created a pretty awkward transition between the story and call to action. In my opinion, topic like this supposed to target students with general background who might interested in environmental issues, instead of information systems student. So along the way i change the storyboard and narrative to aim the students with general background (can be from any major).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My journey in creating part 2 started with creating the wireframes / storyboards takes time around 1-3 days, fully thinking about how to refine the story lines from the last project part and how to add more things in the outline or storyboard narrative structure, in other words, i was thinking how to elaborate content and its structure to tell a compelling story.

I write down my thoughts and try to refine my structure in word doc for these past days, then i immediately shift it to the shorthand app. I find that shorthand is really useful to create a compelling story and presentation. but it gets laggy when there are more wireframes and moving background, so it does take longer time to write and manage everything.

The endless features it brings me to explore my creativity with limitless possibilities, it really interest me to be able to create a compelling story with my own choice of mood boards, background theme, transitions, text placement and style.

For this part, i decided to use two tools as my main weapons :

first, i use tableau, all the data visualizations on my shorthand presentation is created by me with the data sources from links that i had listed on my part 1 project submisson github.

second, i use shorthand, i find it as a really great tool to create persuasive, aestethic, and compelling story telling deck presentation. Also i find it easy to use, took couple of hours(around 1-3 hours) to learn the tool, but the deck / wireframes itself took 2-3 days to complete, here is my link to this project : Shorthand Link

I have developed a shorthand presentation containing a storyboard that lays out the necessary progression through sketches and / or wireframes for this project. The sketches/wireframes that i provided are high-fidelity, and also for the data visualizations i already provided individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of the story. The outline of the story is clear, and the data visualizations appear to fit well in the context of the outline. There are a sufficient number of data visualizations and they provide a good summary of the story that i wish to tell. Information is logically presented and easy to follow. Sketches and/or wireframes and scenarios of use bring opportunity areas to life especially the call to action for students that can bring opportunity to really participate and know what activities to do in order to participate.

Also i already indentify the data visualizations and sketches, include examples of how the real data might be rendered. Data visualizations that i provide are appropriate for the project and of sufficient quantity and quality to tell a compelling story. I also already referenced and used important elements like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements appropriately for the data visualizations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have also created a simple user research protocol that describes what the goal of my research is, including the questions i intended to ask my interviewees by showing my early wireframes / storyboards to at least three different individuals.

The protocol i made already include details of who is the target audience, what approach to identifying representative individuals to interview that i will use, the interview script.

#### My User Research Protocol Will Clearly Identify the Following:
A. The target audience I hope to reach with my story
B. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
C. My interview script

After defining and knowing my target audience, i tried to think and breakdown what approach i need to use to identify representative individuals and who to reach with my story during my interviews. I finally decided to breakdown my approach into something like below.

To make sure of the validity and relevance of the user research for my project targeting students from general backgrounds, I created a strategic approach to identifying representative individuals to interview. Here’s how I plan to do it:

##### Define Target Demographics
I will first define the demographic characteristics of students that align with my target audience. This may include factors such as age range, educational background, specific areas of interest field, and their availability to be interviewed.

Academic Background: I will verify that the individuals are currently enrolled in or recently graduated from university, within any major, because the aim is for general students.

Areas of Interest: I will try to determine the specific areas of interest within the field that align with my project, such as sustainable environment, sustainable energy, etc. But this is not mandatory since in my opinion almost everyone supposed to want to help make our environment to be less harmful.

Availability and Accessibility: I will make sure that the individuals are available and willing to participate in the interview process within mydesignated timeframe. Consider factors such as scheduling conflicts, geographic location (if conducting in-person interviews), and accessibility needs.

##### Ask colleagues that we have worked together from many Courses at CMU (which match the demographic criteria).
I will look into my friends from various courses or backgrounds in CMU since this aim for general background students.

##### Ask friends from my Indonesian CMU Student Organizations (which match the demographic criteria).
I will try to leverage my Indonesian Student Organization friends and networks within CMU. They are really helpful and as well many have diverse backgrounds and also studying at CMU.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, I created interview script with list of 5-7 questions to get a meaningful feedback and insights from the interviewees, I try to come up with the most valuable and important questions to ask, since at first i created 15-20 questions and i think those are too much and kinda overwhelmed the interviewees, so in that case i try to minimize the numbers and come with the most important questions that i think can emphasize and help refine my shorthand storyboards in terms of context, structure, data visualizations, wireframes, etc.

List of goals from my research, and the questions I intend to ask the interviewees.

#### Interview script

Goal: Get Ideas of Audience General Understanding About my Story/Context

##### General Understanding
Can you tell me what you think this is?
Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Goal: Finding Insight to Enhance Storyboards Structure (The Presentation Story Structure)

##### Storyboards Structure (The Presentation Story Structure)
What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling

Goal: Get Ideas On How to Enhance Wireframes (each slides/content that build the presentation)

##### Wireframes (each slides/content that build the presentation)
Is the progression through wireframes already great ?

Goal: Finding Insight to Enhance Data Visualization (Graphics)

##### Data Visualizations
Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, I already completed interviewing five people. These interviewees are ranging from student 24-34’s, but i already remove all PII and any sensitive information.

I already documented the findings from the interviews, including specific insights and observations, key quotes and other learnings.

Detail the findings from my interviews.

##### Interview Findings / User Findings
(Student, mid 20’s)
Can you tell me what you think this is?
Article about climate change due to massive energy consumption

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Policy maker, scientist in the field of energy, country leaders, individual

What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling?
It’s very text heavy article, you could add more visual or highlight important points to help reader grasp the idea

Is the progression through wireframes already great ?
Yeah but I’m not sure why you suddenly focus on US gas emission because at the beginning we discussed about the world and top countries that consume/generate a lot of energy. maybe you could keep the focus on global or just choose specific countries consistenly

Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
I think you can add visual about impact of earth hour

Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?
The size on the shorthand is small, so it’s pretty hard to see and a lot of the axis writing gets cut off. It’s better if you’re consistent in using the colors too

(Student, late 20s)
Can you tell me what you think this is?
A website campaigning earth hour

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
General audience, people who care about environment

What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling?
Structure is OK and compelling, however the content is too long so it’s hard to follow along and understand the gist of the topic

Is the progression through wireframes already great ?
Yes, the progression already clear and smooth

Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
Yes, its enough to tell a compelling story

Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?
Yes, the elements in the visuals already use clear annotations, legends, captions, data source appropriately

(Student, early 30s)
Can you tell me what you think this is?
A call to save the earth

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
General public

What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling?
Good structure that shows the actions and consequences

Is the progression through wireframes already great ?
Yes the progression is already good, but the number of text on each slide/wireframe should be reduce,

Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
Yes, its sufficient to tell a compelling story

Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?
Some charts need a data label on it to show the actual numbers since it is depicted in quite a big scale (terawatts)

(Student, mid 30s)
Can you tell me what you think this is?
This is a presentation how as a student to help preventing and reducing climate change.

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Everyone but specially students

(Student, mid 20s)
Can you tell me what you think this is?
An advertisement to advocate people to help save the environment.

Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Everyone?.

What about the story narrative structure, do you think it is great or not for story telling?
Yes, it is a good way to tell story. The background picture is very impressive, there’re also many graphs help explain. Maybe a story line at the front of page may help people to understand the whole structure better.

Is the progression through wireframes already great ?
The design of the graphs is compatible and ease to the eye

Are the number of data visualizations sufficient to tell a compelling story ?
I think so. There’re data from different countries and different angles.

Important elements in the visuals like titles, annotations, legends, captions, axis, data source and other elements are referenced and used appropriately ?
Yes, no need to improve since it’s already clear.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, I already identified what changes that I plan on implementing for Part III based on the feedback to address any issues raised in the user research or interview feedbacks.

#### Identified Changes for Part III

##### Findings or observations from interviews
From my interviews conducted with five people, i higlighted several comments and critique that can be use for further improvements, here are the highlights :

- It’s very text heavy article, you could add more visual or highlight important points to help reader grasp the idea
- Yeah but I’m not sure why you suddenly focus on US gas emission because at the beginning we discussed about the world and top countries that consume/generate a lot of energy. maybe you could keep the focus on global or just choose specific countries consistenly
- I think you can add visual about impact of earth hour
- The size on the shorthand is small, so it’s pretty hard to see and a lot of the axis writing gets cut off. It’s better if you’re consistent in using the colors too
- Structure is OK and compelling, however the content is too long so it’s hard to follow along and understand the gist of the topic
- Yes the progression is already good, but the number of text on each slide/wireframe should be reduce,
- Some charts need a data label on it to show the actual numbers since it is depicted in quite a big scale (terawatts)
- Maybe a story line at the front of page may help people to understand the whole structure better.

##### Changes That I Will Implement for The Final Deliverables
Based on the feedback provided by the interviewees, I will create a list of changes that I could implement to improve my final project deliverables :

- I will try to incorporate more visuals such as images related to the content and try to break up the text-heavy content and highlight important points. Reducing the amount of text on each slide or wireframe to improve readability and comprehension.
- I will keep maintaining consistency in focus throughout the storyboards, either keeping it focusing on global or focusing on specific countries consistently.
- I will add more visuals illustrating the impact of Earth Hour to make the concept more tangible for readers.
- Increase the font size and ensure that all text is clearly visible, especially on charts and graphs where axis labels may get cut off.
- I will use more consistent colors throughout the project for better visual coherence.
- Streamlining the content to make it more concise and easier for readers to follow along and grasp the main idea.
- I will include data labels for the actual numbers, especially when depicting data on a large scale such as terawatts.
- I will plan to consider giving a story line at the front of page may help people to understand the whole structure better.
I will elaborate more during the journey working on the part III, some of these points i already tried to fix, i just want to write these in this github page since these are my thoughts on what can be improve and what are the focus, by implementing these changes, I think i can enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of my final project deliverables and create a much better wireframes, storyboards that can help me on the final presentation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Moodboards / personas
And lastly, I already did this in the shorthand link, I tried to make the tone, background, theme, and mood related to the topic of climate change environment, etc. I find it as a really great tool to create persuasive, aestethic, and compelling story telling deck presentation that can emphasize audience mood as well. it took me couple of days create it.


### Summary of Journey Creating Part III
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Part III Journey i try my best to spend so much time possible to rework on the shorthand, this is because it will be presented only 60 seconds and also needs to be able to persuade and create engagement with the audience, so i really think deeply how can i reengineer the presentation deck and come up with lots of great ideas to persuade people into the content and call to actions. 

In that case, I tried to polish everything that i think needed to be polish from part II, based on the feedback provided by the interviewees below :

- I will try to incorporate more visuals such as images related to the content and try to break up the text-heavy content and highlight important points. Reducing the amount of text on each slide or wireframe to improve readability and comprehension.
- I will keep maintaining consistency in focus throughout the storyboards, either keeping it focusing on global or focusing on specific countries consistently.
- I will add more visuals illustrating the impact of Earth Hour to make the concept more tangible for readers.
- Increase the font size and ensure that all text is clearly visible, especially on charts and graphs where axis labels may get cut off.
- I will use more consistent colors throughout the project for better visual coherence.
- Streamlining the content to make it more concise and easier for readers to follow along and grasp the main idea.
- I will include data labels for the actual numbers, especially when depicting data on a large scale such as terawatts.
- I will plan to consider giving a story line at the front of page may help people to understand the whole structure better.

**Note : eventhough there are several feedback that i can mostly use above to rework my shorthand story and its details, mostly i made my change with my own critical thinking and creative thinking, and then rejustify it by looking at above feedback iteratively, i think this is a great combination to rework things, so that i can deliver the best storyline, structure, and also supporting image / data visuals, to create a good persuasive story telling presentation deck.**

#### Changes made since Part II

The thing i change mostly occurs in the shorthand, these are the things i changed :

1. I change the title according to what makes more sense with the story, so my choice is : It's Time to Make A Change, Climate Change is Ahead of Us.
What's Our Answer?
2. I increase the font size for most of the wireframe text content, in order to make what i'm trying to say is clear and emphasized, so it makes my presentation more persuasive to the whole audience.
3. As in your comments from part II rubric, i already fix and keep working on the story. I changed the majority of the content which back then was mostly long content of reviewing what climate change and fossil fuels are, and try to aim my audience for general students so it become more make sense and focus. I also remove several CTA's so i put only 3 to make the audience curious about more actionable things that they can do to participate eart hour and visit the link
5. I tighten up content and making it concise and easy to follow and digest while i present it in front of the audience. now it doesnt take almost 5 sections to reach my first data visualization. already condense the background information in the front.
6. I already remove the map visualization because i think its not really needed, the information is actually the same as the line graph so it can be shown only with 1 aggregate nice graphic. I also keep the color consistent between the content or wireframe and look aesthetical.
7. Also i reworked on the graph titles making the font bigger and make it more relatable with the content
8. I already add data sources below each tableau visualization on my shorthand as well, so it surpass the publicly accessable criteria.
9. I also rework on the earth hour milestone, it is created by me and i also put citation below the shorthand to make sure i refer to several milestone that i use wisely and change several words or phrasing.
10. I change the project structure, condensed into climate change, world energy consumption, fossil fuel combustion and straight to call to action, then emphasize earth hour as the call to action and how students can participate
11. mostly rework the text and colors, make it concise and easy to follow and read.

##### The audience
Since my topic emphasize on earth hour as an act to foster awareness for people to prevent climate change going onwards, i'm targeting student from various backgrounds, and suggesting various ways for students to contribute reducing climate change through participating earth hour initiatives, since i think and also discuss with lot of people who thought the same, that sense of protecting nature is actually human nature, to protect the environment when they know it will create threat for them.

After defining and knowing my target audience, i tried to think and breakdown what approach i need to use to identify representative individuals and who to reach with my story during my interviews. I finally decided to breakdown my approach into something like below.

##### Final design decisions
This is already elaborated in the changes i made for since part II section above, but the final design decision mostly come from iterative thinking, interview feedback, looking at others presentation deck when presenting, and also ask for advise from people close to me, so it can become synergize and create a solid final design for the storyboard and visuals.

##### References
I already add data sources references above in the part 1 journey section, also in the shorthand link on the bottom page of the presentation deck.

# Final thoughts
Actually i'm really excited with all the journey i've been through from part I till part III, at first i was thinking that the challenge from each part will make me confused and frustrated at first, but actually once i notice what the end goal is, and seeing instructions one by one from each part, i started to sense the puzzle and put it together. im became much more engaged and interested knowing that im amazed that i actually can properly use tableau and shorthand in only few days, it is a new journey for me at the beginning using these kind of tools and i never think that creating all of this as portofolio would be possible at first, but in the end im really glad i did all of this with thorough thinking, and spent days even weeks thinking about all this. 

There are tons of things that can be a positive reflection during the journey since the beginning of the class until the final project, especially when i have doubts i ask professor a lot and get a really nice feedback from him and guidance that most of them i reflect it and elaborate more through my final project work, it really help me navigate blurriness and all of the confusement i had back then. I also ask some friends to brainstorm the idea until i remember that i had once participate in earth hour, and that was my aha! moment. glad that it will be in my portofolio.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other than my personal journey and feelings toward it, i want to also give a checklist of things i already add to this part III:

1. I already complete the final deliverable publicly accessible as a digital asset (shorthand).
2. I also already have a writeup on Github that summarizes my work in the final week.
3. I also completed your presentation of final project during class. 
4. I also already submit with this a Word document that includes the text for my final report submitted through TurnItIn. 
5. I also already Included all references for materials used, i clearly identified it as well on my final data story.
6. I also already linked the final project Part I, II and III story summary in this page.
7. I also already created Github page(s) for final project, well organized and summarizes all the work done thus far. and provides behind the scenes look at how the work was created for Part III. 
8. I also already created Link to Github repository (portfolio page) and the final publicly available Shorthand (or other acceptable site) is included. 
9. Github page(s) for final project is complete, well organized and summarizes all the work done thus far. Provides behind the scenes look at how the work was created for Part III. Link to Github repository (portfolio page) and the final publicly available Shorthand (or other acceptable site) is included. Other information as relevant / needed included in the Part III writeu
10. Images are cited correctly, follow library guidelines on acceptable use. Links working. Final page includes all links / references for everything used in project. Citations are detailed enough to easily track back to original sources.
11. Part III writeup includes a few paragraphs that talk about the intended audience, personas if used, and changes made with the audience in mind.
12. A few paragraphs summarizing work, design decisions and observations.
13. Embedded visualizations working correctly and appear appropriate for the audience. Colors support understanding of the information and don't distract from the message. Other elements work with the overall deliverable, not against it. Data visualizations are easy to interpret and understand.
14. The final deliverable is well written and seems appropriate for the audience. The content appears to reinforce the correct interpretation of the data visualizations. The Word document has been submitted and issues identified by TurnItIn have been addressed.
15. All elements seem to work together seamlessly. The project feels complete and is not missing elements. Other supporting elements (citations, references, interactions, animations) appear to be working correctly.
