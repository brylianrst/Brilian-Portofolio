# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brilian, a graduate student at MISM 12 and also a dedicated data enthusiast with a background in Project Management and Business Analyst. My journey into the vast realm of data began with a spark of curiosity, and since then, I've been on a mission to unravel the stories hidden within the numbers. In my day-to-day work back then i analyzed data to gain insights for deciding project initiatives. I've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of data in making informed decisions and driving positive outcomes. My fascination with the potential of data led me to embark on this exciting journey of continuous learning.

# What I hope to learn
In this "Telling Stories with Data" course, I'm eager to delve deeper into the art and science of effective data storytelling. My goal is to not only master the technical aspects of creating compelling visualizations but also to understand the psychology behind impactful data communication. Specifically, I hope to gain insights into :
- Crafting narratives: I want to learn how to weave a compelling story around data, making it accessible and engaging for a diverse audience.
- Visualization techniques: I aim to enhance my skills in creating visually appealing and informative charts, graphs, and dashboards.
- Ethical considerations: Understanding the ethical implications of data storytelling is crucial. I want to explore how to communicate data responsibly and transparently.
  
Throughout the course, I'm excited to collaborate with fellow learners, exchange ideas, and receive constructive feedback. Together, let's uncover the secrets hidden in the data and learn the art of telling stories that resonate and inspire action.

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 

[Part I](final-project-part-one)
Part I: a project proposal.  An outline of your project, copies of data, and the identified method you'll use for presenting.

[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part II: Sketches, wireframes, storyboards.  User research and incorporating user feedback.

Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
